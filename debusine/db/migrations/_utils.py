    `ValueError: Cannot query "C (...)": Must be "C" instance` when trying

    changes model A can manually reload model D by including something like

# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/howto/writing-migrations/#changing-a-manytomanyfield-to-use-a-through-model
# gives advice on renaming the table used as a "through" model for a
# many-to-many field, but it doesn't handle renaming the associated
# constraints, indexes, and sequences whose names were generated based on
# the original table name.  It seems quite difficult to extract the relevant
# names from the Django migrator so that we can generate the appropriate SQL
# statements to rename them all.  And we can't just query the relevant
# PostgreSQL catalog tables in the migration, because the current database
# state might not match the projected migration state (e.g. in sqlmigrate).
#
# PL/pgSQL to the rescue!  We generate SQL that queries the catalog tables
# to find the associated constraints, indexes, and sequences, and executes
# the appropriate ALTER statements.  When that SQL is actually executed, the
# database state must be up to date.
#
# The catalog queries here are simplified from
# django.db.backends.postgresql.introspection.
