Debusine signing settings.

The settings are created dynamically by first importing defaults
values from :py:mod:`debusine.signing.settings.defaults` and then
values from :py:mod:`debusine.signing.settings.local` (or from
:py:mod:`debusine.signing.settings.selected` if the latter
has not been created by the administrator).
