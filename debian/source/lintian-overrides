# This normally shouldn't be needed when the package works with all
# currently-supported Python versions, but pypy lags behind slightly and
# causes problems without this.  See https://bugs.debian.org/1074254.  This
# can be removed if the pypy3 version in stable supports our minimum Python
# version.
