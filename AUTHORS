History
-------

Debusine has been initiated by Raphaël Hertzog in 2019 but it was mostly
dormant until Freexian started to fund its development in 2021 by paying
for the work of Carles Pina i Estany. In 2023, Freexian obtained funding
from SovereignTechFund.de to accelerate the pace of its development and
achieve some significant milestones.
