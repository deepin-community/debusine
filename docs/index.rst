Debusine: a CI platform for Debian-based distributions
======================================================

Debusine's goal is to be an integrated solution to build, distribute and
maintain a Debian-based distribution.

Debusine is already a modern cloud-powered Continuous Integration (CI)
platform to run many packaging and distribution related workflows
for the Debian ecosystem. It can be used to automate everything from the
package build up to the generation of installer/disk/cloud/container
images, including all the intermediary quality assurance checks. It is
very versatile and easy to extend to cater to custom requirements.

To cope with the scale (dozens of thousands of packages), and with the
breadth of supported CPU architectures of a Linux distribution, Debusine
manages the scheduling and distribution of individual tasks to distributed
worker machines, including cloud workers on demand.

If you are new to Debusine, you will want to read
:ref:`introduction` first.

.. note::

    The documentation is structured by following the `Di√°taxis
    <https://diataxis.fr/>`_ principles: tutorials and explanation
    are mainly useful to discover and learn, howtos and reference are
    more useful when you are familiar with Debusine already and you
    have some specific action to perform or goal to achieve.
