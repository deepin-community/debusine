Workflows
=========

Workflows are server-side logic that can schedule and combine server
tasks and worker tasks to automate complex operations.

Workflows are created from a workflow template chosen from a set maintained by
the server administrators, plus data coming from user input.

See the :ref:`explanation-workflows` for an overview, and below for
technical details.  There is also documentation of the :ref:`internal API
<api-workflows>` used by workflow orchestrators.
