Sponsors
========

Debusine development has been made possible with the money provided
by multiple organizations that we're calling sponsors for the sake
of simplicity here.

Current sponsors
================

Freexian
--------

Freexian has been investing lots of time and money into Debusine,
for their own use and in the hope to help Debian modernize its
infrastructure. They are keeping track of their contribution on
their `OpenCollective page
<https://opencollective.com/freexian/projects/debusine>`_.

Historical sponsors
===================

Sovereign Tech Agency
---------------------

Between September 2023 and February 2025, most of Debusine's development
work was funded through the “Sovereign Tech Fund”, a program of the
`Sovereign Tech Agency <https://www.sovereign.tech/>`. The `STF milestones
<https://salsa.debian.org/freexian-team/debusine/-/milestones?search_title=STF&state=closed&sort=due_date_desc>`_
funded by this project enabled us to build all the important Debusine
building blocks.
